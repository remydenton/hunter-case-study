						* URL of online slides in case you want to follow along, study more closely after we've moved on
						* while you're copying it down, a quick intro of Isovera:
  						** Drupal consultancy and dev shop based in the Boston area.  focus exclusively on Drupal
  						** Projects really run the gamut-- particular expertise in commerce, search

					<h2>The project: A little background</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Hunter Boots sells fashion apparel</li>
						<li class="fragment">This is the site we're talking about: <a href="us.hunterboots.com">us.hunterboots.com</a></li>
						<li class="fragment">U.S. site launched on Drupal in Q4 2011</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* A big fashion brand, bread and butter is <em>very</em> expensive rain boots.  redesigns, constant ad campagins, new product lines
						* Launced 2011--early commerce days--you might think it's be outdated, but VERY active iteration.
						   ** redesigns
						   ** heavy growth -- before 2011, it was a brochure site
						* More opportunity to learn from our mistakes.

					<h2>1. "Merchandising" products using draggable views</h2>
					<p>Problem: Admins want to be able to change order of product displays in a view</p>
					<img src="images/product-listing.png"/>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Original Solution</h3>
					<p>Add a "Product Order" field to the product display content type.</p>
					<img src="images/product-order-field.png"/>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Why is this a terrible idea?</h3>
					<div><img src="images/product-listing.png"/></div>
					<ul>
						<li>Difficult to maintain</li>
						<li class="fragment">Not flexible</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						Describe moving one product to the top of the list
						   * Guess at the weight
						   * Even worse if moving to a specific spot (must know weight of before and after nodes)
						Flexibility: pages using the same view with different contextual filters
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>A Better solution</h3>
					<p>Add a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/draggableviews">draggable views</a> attachment to the view</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>How this works</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Add a new attachment display to your view, format as 'table'</li>
						<li class="fragment">Ensure the filter criteria (including contextual filters) match</li>
						<li class="fragment">Add 'Draggableviews: Weight' as a sort criterion</li>
						<li class="fragment">Update permissions so only admins can see the attachment</li>
					</ol>
					<p><br /></p>
					<div class="fragment"><small>For more info, see the "Creating a sorting interface" section of the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/283498">Draggable views documentation</a></small></div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="images/reordering.gif" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Bonus Tip</h3>
					If views caching is enabled, use the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/cache_actions">cache actions</a> module.
					<img class="fragment" src="images/cache-actions-rule.png" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>2. Uploading new products using feeds</h2>
					<p>Problem: Several times a year, Hunter adds <em>a lot</em> of new product</p>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* This isn't new (feeds is the obvious solution), but there are many ways to do it
						* Share some tips and tricks
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Low-tech solution</h3>
					<p>Add products manually</p>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* Okay for small uploads, but not scalable.
					</aside>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Better Solution: Feeds</h3>
					<p>Hunter sends us three things:</p>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment">A spreadsheet of new product display nodes</li>
						<li class="fragment">A spreadsheet of new commerce products</li>
						<li class="fragment">A directory of images (referenced in the product spreadsheet)</li>
					</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Then, we run two imports:</p>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment">Product display node importer</li>
							<ol type="a" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
								<li class="fragment">Run this import a second time to add related products</li>
							</ol>
						<li class="fragment">Commerce product importer</li>
							<ol type="a" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
								<li class="fragment">Uses <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_feeds">Commerce Feeds</a> module</li>
								<li class="fragment">Run only after uploading the images to the public files directory</li>
							</ol>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* Displays: title, text fields, keywords (metadata)
						** Related products

				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Attaching commerce products to displays</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Arbitrary, unique "style code"</li>
						<li>Attaching happens during the import of <em>either</em> feed</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* Why either?  
							* It's okay to run either feed as many times as you want.
							* Flexibility in case you're dealing with a mix of new and existing data.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Massaging the data</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Leverage feeds tamper when possible</li>
							<img src="images/feeds-tamper.png"/>
						<li class="fragment">It's okay to use formulas in your spreadsheet</li>
							<img class="fragment" src="images/feeds-size-fit.png"/>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Feeds Best practices</h3>
					<div>
						<p>Create a spec for the spreadsheets</p>
						<small>(for both admins and yourself)</small>
						<div class="fragment"><img src="images/feeds-spec.png"/></div>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* Could be six months between importsâ€”document for yourself!
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Feeds Best practices</h2>
					<div>
						<p>Set error messages whenever you possibly can</p>
						<small>(errors in the data are practically guaranteed)</small>
						<p><br/></p>
						<div class="fragment">
						<pre><code class="php" data-trim contenteditable>
drupal_set_message(t('No product display with the display code %display_code exists.',
  array('%display_code' => $display_code)), 'warning', FALSE);
				    </code></pre>
				    </div>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Feeds Best practices</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Be very careful when updating existing commerce products
							<div class="fragment"><img src="images/price-zero.png"/></div>
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">Import as published/enabled when testing, unpublished/disabled on production</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* Create a separate importer for imports.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>3. Allowing admins to run custom actions on an order</h2>
					<div>
						<p>Problem: Admins want to re-post an order to the warehouse.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Problem: Admins want to recalculate sales tax for an order.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Original Solution</h3>
					<p>Just take care of it on the command line...</p>
					<p><br/></p>
					<small><code class="fragment">$ drush ev _hunter_orders_post_xml_to_ph($order, TRUE);</code></small>

					<small><code>/admin/commerce/orders</code></small>

					<h2>4. Using domain context to build two sites in one</h2>
					<ol>
					 <li class="fragment">We run both US and CA sites off of one Drupal site without using Localization</li>
					 <li class="fragment">Relies on both contexts and country codes/domains set in the settings.php file</li>
					 <li class="fragment">Product availability is specified using "Available In" fields as well as country specific pricing fields</li>

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            * Uses domains set in settings.php file to allow testing of which domain we are on
            * uses contexts
            * allows easy management by editors
          </aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
          <h2>Why didn't we use localization?</h2>
          <ol>
           <li class="fragment">Localization requires the creation of duplicate content for each country.</li>
           <li class="fragment">This would be additional work for content editors, as well as be very complex when integrated with our product/product display methodology.</li>
          </ol>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            * Touch on the difficult nature of having to have duplicate content for every node for localization
            * Review the product/product display plans. Product is a specific item, ex. pink hunter welly boot. Where as the product displays are a group of products ex, Welly Boot.

          <ol>
             <li class="fragment">The #1 issue we faced on this project was that we were not provided an API spec, we had to reverse engineer files created by our US warehouse. 
             While this isn't really a cool "tech" topic to discuss. It brings to light some of the difficulties you may have integrating with 3rd parties
             </li>
             <li class="fragment">We needed to ensure that these files contained info on the items that were returned, unfourtunately, the return process actually removes the returned items</li>
             <li class="fragment">Our FTP server needed to live in a CHROOTED home directory that the webserver could not have access too</li>

          <h2>Issue #2 "No Returned Items after Return Completes" - Solution?: Using Entity Metadata Wrappers and Timing the Creation vs Saving of files</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">We implemented SimpleXML in conjunction with Entity Metadata Wrappers of the Commerce Order object to generate the XML files</li>
            <li class="fragment">This works great for generating Order files on the transition from Processing to Complete, but returns need extra work</li>
            <li class="fragment">Since items are removed from the order during the return process, we generate the XML at the beginning of the return, but save once it is completed</li>
            <li class="fragment">This allows us to have access to the full order object, but not actually send the data until the return is authorized and completed</li>

            <li class="fragment">Since we don't want the webserver to be able to write directly to the FTP location, use a root cron job to sync files to the FTP from private files</li>
            <li class="fragment">This has the added benefit of creating an archive of all files, regardless of what the Retailpro FTP account does with them</li>
